## About the Project :

This aim of this project is of fulfill the basic requirement of students and teacher. Where both may work together as a team. Basically, it is developed for the students, teachers and also for organization. It provides the newest way to assign the work to students. In this application, teacher assign the class work to the student with providing the due date of submission. Work can also be submitted after this due date but it marks late and faculty may also reduce the grades. In this, we use cloud the service(S3) to store the files of students so that their data must be maintain at secure place. Due to cloud services, it is easy to upload/download files on cloud via internet so that their files are available to them at any time. It provides attractive interface for the users as per the requirement. Here, it have one more feature which ensures the students that their work not treat as garbage, generally happen in the old class work, so faculty must observe the assignment work carefully. Anyone can ask doubts with their respective faculty through private comment section. It increases the portability of doing the work rather than notebook because we generally less comfortable to write more on notebooks and it is also time consuming process. To run this application, there is no need of providing the essential information by the user. Today is online word where everything is done with internet, so why not education can be online. 

## Motivation :

This project works mainly in education but it can also work in other fields like for organization and industry. It may be a major project in future with providing some more useful features that may be customized as per the user needs. It is also eco-friendly because there is no need of tearing down the notebook again and again for work submission, so indirectly it is beneficial for developing society.
